# CQRS

This project is built on a **feature-based structure**, making it easier to organize, scale, and maintain your codebase — ultimately delivering a smoother development experience.

## What's inside
- **CQRS** – a clean separation of queries and commands for clearer intent and maintainable logic.
- **Custom Endpoint Handler** – each endpoint lives in its own file, keeping everything strictly feature-based and easy to navigate.  

## What's it for?
I use this as a **template for my personal projects**, designed to work out-of-the-box without relying heavily on external packages.  
The idea is simple: keep full control of the codebase and avoid the risk of dependencies suddenly going behind a paywall — so every project stays maintainable and future-proof.  

## The future of this project/tempalte
In the near future, I plan to separate the **CQRS logic** and the **Custom Endpoint Handler** into two standalone packages.  
This is because keeping them modular makes it easier to reuse, update, and maintain them independently across multiple projects.
